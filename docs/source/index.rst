Welcome to WhiskerGarden's documentation!
=========================================

**WhiskerGarden** is a comprehensive mental health application that combines a mood tracker and activity calendar to help users monitor their daily emotional well-being and routines. The goal of this project is to help university students balance their academics, personal well-being, and daily habits. The app allows students to care for a virtual plant, which reflects their progress and consistency. It also includes a timetable for managing schedules and a mood diary to track emotional well-being.

The application is built using Flutter SDK for cross-platform mobile development, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices. The backend is powered by FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework for building APIs.
