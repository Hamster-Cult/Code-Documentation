User authentication 
Users will be able to safely register and log in with their social media or email addresses thanks to the user authentication system. To provide a smooth 
login process, extra options such as “Forgot password” and “Reset password” will be included. 

Plant care system 
The Plant Care System allows users to select a virtual plant that represents their progress in task management and maintaining their habits. Completing 
activities and logging moods will “nurture” the plant, allowing it to develop over time. Neglecting tasks or engaging in inconsistent behaviour may lead
to the plant showing poor signs of health, encouraging users to stay on track. 

Timetable/Calendar 
Users will be able to make and manage their weekly and daily schedules with the help of the Timetable function. Users can browse their schedule in a calendar 
format, add classes, tasks, personal activities and create reminders for themselves. For improved organisation, the timetable will support any recurring events 
and include options such as colour-coding to improve the overall experience. 

Mood diary
The mood diary will allow users to log their moods daily, providing a space for them to write about how they feel during the day. It will display a visual mood 
chart where you are able to see the trend of a user’s mood, helping them track their well-being. Each day the user will be asked to rate their mood by selecting 
an appropriate visual icon that represents their emotion.
