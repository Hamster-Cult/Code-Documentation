Mood Logging:

The Mood Logging feature provides the user to be able to log an daily entry of how they are feeling and their current mood. By using this feature, it will help to boost plant EXP.

By clicking on the "Write today's entry", the user is able to write a description of their current mood. This will then be logged and saved. After this the user is able to go back and look at any past entrys.

Calendar:
---------
For the Calendar, a user will be able to see current date of their creation, which is also connected to theMood Entries.

With the Calendar a user is able to input data such as , a title, a desription and the time for their events.

Additional features also include customisation of the calendar, such as the colour scheme. Also a user will be able to export their current/existing calendar to other calendars, so they can sync if they have other events.

Plant System:
-------------
User is able to choose a plant upon joining the app, but also not restricted in resetting and or changing the plant. EXP will be giving the more the plant grows, however, if reset it will also reset the EXP given.

Once EXP max level is reached the plant will be put on a window shelf in home page and another plant can be chosen to start the process again.

Status will also be shown to a user so they know how their plant is doing EXP wise.
